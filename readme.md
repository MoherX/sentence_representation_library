# Neural Sentence Representation Model implemented using PyTorch

This repository provide a PyTorch based framework with multi-choices of models to represent sentence including Bi-Lstm、Lstm、CNN、Sum and Tree-Lstm. Furthermore,you can make use of character-level features using Char-CNN or Char-LSTM to leverage character-level information.Based on this framework,you can build several models quickly.
